**This project is a Colab-Based python notebook which has the following phases:**
1. Mount Colab Drive to get the files
2. Get images from github
3. Building Data Structures for FastAI model
4. Building Classification Model
5. Classifier confusion matrix
6. Show predictions with greater loss
7. Some random prediction examples


**Follow these instructions to run the code successfully:**
1. Download the .ipynb file and upload to your Google Drive, open it with Google Colab
2. Give the permission to Colab to access your files (cell with code drive.mount)
3. Modify the path variables: path, mainfoldername, otherfoldername
4. Run !
